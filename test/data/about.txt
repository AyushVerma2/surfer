Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem for sharing data and services.
It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute
and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on
availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements.
There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and
ward against Sybil Attacks.
